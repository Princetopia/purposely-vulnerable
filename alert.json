The parameter may include quote characters, so this code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.\n\nIn the second case, the user-supplied request attribute is passed to the database using query parameters. The database connector library will take care of escaping and inserting quotes as needed.\n\nIn the third case, the placeholder in the SQL string has been manually quoted. Since most databaseconnector libraries will insert their own quotes, doing so yourself will make the code vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. In this example, if `username` was `; DROP ALL TABLES -- `, the final SQL query would be `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''; DROP ALL TABLES -- ''`\n\n\n```python\nfrom django.conf.urls import url\nfrom django.db import connection\n\n\ndef show_user(request, username):\n    with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n        # BAD -- Using string formatting\n        cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s'\" % username)\n        user = cursor.fetchone()\n\n        # GOOD -- Using parameters\n        cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s\", username)\n        user = cursor.fetchone()\n\n        # BAD -- Manually quoting placeholder (%s)\n        cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s'\", username)\n        user = cursor.fetchone()\n\nurlpatterns = [url(r'^users/(?P<username>[^/]+)$', show_user)]\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n* OWASP: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* [SQLAlchemy documentation for TextClause](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text.params.text).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html).\n","security_severity_level":"high"},"tool":{"name":"CodeQL","guid":null,"version":"2.23.5"},"most_recent_instance":{"ref":"refs/heads/main","analysis_key":".github/workflows/codeql.yml:analyze","environment":"{}","category":"/language:python","state":"open","commit_sha":"0d7b62a3a6bcc3528a149ba4659a29a4ad2ea6a4","message":{"text":"This SQL query depends on a user-provided value."},"location":{"path":"vulnerable_app.py","start_line":67,"end_line":67,"start_column":20,"end_column":25},"classifications":[]},"instances_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/code-scanning/alerts/2/instances","dismissal_approved_by":null,"assignees":[]}
