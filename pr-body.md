Fixes https://github.com/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/security/code-scanning/1

## Summary

Replaced string formatting with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, or modify database contents by injecting malicious SQL code through user input

## Fix Applied

Changed both vulnerable SQL queries to use ? placeholders and pass user input as tuple parameters to cursor.execute(), ensuring user data is properly escaped and treated as data only.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data by using placeholders (?), which are safely substituted by the database driver, preventing any user input from being interpreted as SQL commands

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like 'admin' OR '1'='1' --' in both username parameter and search query to verify it's treated as literal strings and doesn't bypass security controls
