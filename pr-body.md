Fixes https://github.com/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/security/code-scanning/2

## Summary

Replaced f-string formatting with parameterized queries in search functionality

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially extracting sensitive data, modifying the database, or bypassing authentication

## Fix Applied

Changed the vulnerable f-string query to use ? placeholder and pass the search pattern as a parameter to cursor.execute(). The LIKE pattern is safely constructed before being passed as a parameter.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data, ensuring the search_term is treated as a literal string value rather than executable SQL code

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like '; DROP TABLE users; -- to verify it's treated as a literal search term and doesn't execute as SQL commands
