Fixes https://github.com/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/security/code-scanning/2

## Summary

Replaced f-string formatting with parameterized queries in search_users function

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially extracting sensitive data, modifying database contents, or bypassing authentication by injecting malicious SQL code through the search parameter

## Fix Applied

Changed the query from f-string formatting (f"SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%{search_term}%'") to use a ? placeholder with parameterized execution (cursor.execute(query, (f'%{search_term}%',))). This matches the secure pattern already established in the get_user function on line 40.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data by using placeholders (?) that are handled by the database driver. The driver ensures user input is treated strictly as data values and cannot be interpreted as SQL commands, preventing injection attacks. The LIKE wildcards (%) are included in the parameter value itself, not in the SQL string.

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious inputs like: (1) q=' OR '1'='1 (2) q='; DROP TABLE users; -- (3) q=' UNION SELECT username, password FROM admin_users -- to verify they are treated as literal search strings and do not execute as SQL commands. The search should return no results or only legitimate matches containing those exact character sequences.
