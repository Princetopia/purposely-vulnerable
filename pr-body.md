## Summary

Replaced f-string formatting with parameterized queries in search function

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious code through the search query parameter, potentially accessing or modifying all database data

## Fix Applied

Changed the vulnerable f-string query construction to use SQLite's parameterized query with ? placeholder. The search term is now passed as a tuple parameter to cursor.execute(), ensuring user input is properly escaped.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data by using placeholders (?). The database driver automatically escapes and quotes the parameter values, preventing any injected SQL from being interpreted as executable code.

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like admin' OR '1'='1-- or '; DROP TABLE users;-- to verify these are treated as literal search strings and don't execute as SQL commands
