Fixes https://github.com/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/security/code-scanning/1

## Summary

Replaced string formatting with parameterized queries in the user search functionality

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious SQL code through the search parameter

## Fix Applied

Changed the query from f-string formatting to use ? placeholder and pass the search term parameter as a tuple to cursor.execute(). The LIKE pattern wildcards are now safely applied to the parameter value rather than being part of the SQL string.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data, ensuring user input is treated as data only and cannot be executed as SQL code. The ? placeholder is replaced by the database engine with the properly escaped parameter value.

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like admin' OR '1'='1-- to verify it's treated as a literal search string and doesn't bypass the WHERE clause or expose unintended data
