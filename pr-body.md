## Summary

Replaced f-string formatting with parameterized queries in search_users function

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection (CWE-089)  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could bypass query logic, extract unauthorized data, modify database contents, or execute administrative operations by injecting malicious SQL code through the search parameter

## Fix Applied

Changed the SQL query construction from using f-string formatting (f"...WHERE username LIKE '%{search_term}%'") to using parameterized queries with the ? placeholder. The user input is now passed separately as a tuple parameter to cursor.execute(), ensuring proper escaping and type handling.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries treat user input as data values rather than executable SQL code. The database driver automatically escapes special characters and properly quotes the input, preventing SQL injection attacks. The LIKE pattern wildcard characters (%) are included in the parameter value itself rather than in the SQL string, maintaining the search functionality while eliminating the injection vector.

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious inputs like: 1) "admin' OR '1'='1" - should be treated as a literal search string, 2) "'; DROP TABLE users; --" - should search for this exact string without executing commands, 3) Normal searches like "admin" or "user" should continue working as expected
