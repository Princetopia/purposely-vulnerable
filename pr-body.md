Fixes https://github.com/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/security/code-scanning/2

## Summary

Replaced f-string formatting with parameterized queries in search function

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying database contents, or bypassing authentication

## Fix Applied

Changed the query from f-string formatting to use ? placeholders and pass the search term as a parameter tuple to cursor.execute(). The LIKE pattern with wildcards is now safely constructed before being passed as a parameter.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data by using ? placeholders. The database engine treats parameter values as literal data only, preventing them from being interpreted as SQL commands regardless of their content.

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like admin'; DROP TABLE users; -- to verify it's treated as a literal search string and doesn't execute as SQL. The search should return no results rather than executing the malicious command.
