Fixes 

## Summary

Replaced string formatting with parameterized queries in the user search function

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection  
**Severity**:   
**Location**: ``

### Security Impact

Attackers could bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious SQL code through the search parameter

## Fix Applied

Changed the query from f-string formatting to use ? placeholders and pass the search term as a parameter tuple to cursor.execute(). The LIKE pattern wildcards are now safely constructed before being passed as a parameter.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data, ensuring user input is treated as data only and cannot be executed as SQL code. The ? placeholder is replaced by SQLite with properly escaped user input.

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like admin' OR '1'='1-- to verify it's treated as a literal search term and doesn't bypass the WHERE clause or execute additional SQL commands
