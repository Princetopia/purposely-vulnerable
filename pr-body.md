Fixes https://github.com/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/security/code-scanning/2

## Summary

Replaced string formatting with parameterized queries in search_users function

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL queries to extract sensitive data, modify the database, or bypass application security controls

## Fix Applied

Changed the SQL query construction from f-string formatting to use ? placeholders and passed the search term as a parameter tuple to cursor.execute(). The LIKE pattern is now safely constructed by including the wildcards in the parameter value.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries ensure that user input is treated as data only and cannot be interpreted as SQL code, preventing malicious SQL injection attacks while preserving the original search functionality

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like admin' OR '1'='1-- to verify it's treated as a literal search term and returns no results instead of all users
