Fixes https://github.com/Princetopia/purposely-vulnerable/security/code-scanning/2

## Summary

Replaced f-string formatting with parameterized queries using ? placeholders

## Vulnerability Details

**Type**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)  
**Severity**: high  
**Location**: `vulnerable_app.py`

### Security Impact

Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands to extract sensitive data, modify database contents, or bypass authentication by injecting malicious SQL code through the search parameter

## Fix Applied

Changed the query from f-string formatting (f"...LIKE '%{search_term}%'") to use ? placeholder and pass the search term as a tuple parameter to cursor.execute(). The wildcard characters (%) were moved to the parameter value to maintain LIKE functionality while preventing injection.

### Technical Details

Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user data by using placeholders (?) that are safely bound by the database driver. The driver properly escapes special characters and ensures user input cannot be interpreted as SQL code, completely eliminating the injection attack vector.

## Testing & Verification

Test with malicious input like ' OR '1'='1' -- or '; DROP TABLE users; -- to verify they are treated as literal search strings. The query should return no results or safe results rather than executing the injected SQL commands.
